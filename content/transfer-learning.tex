\chapter{Methods for transfer learning}

As I want to test both architectures' performance on a higher-order task (i.e. Multi Object Tracking), it is strongly advisable to train them for my specific workload. All the referenced neural network architectures have been trained on the COCO dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset of labeled images, containing X categories for `stuff` and Y categories for things. The capacity to distinguish between these can sometimes hurt the capacity to distinguish between a fewer number of categories.
