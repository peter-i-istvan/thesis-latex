\chapter{Higher Order Applications: Multiple Object Tracking}

As the final aim of my thesis, I am going to inspect the performance of the chosen object detectors on a higher-order problem, namely multiple object tracking. First I am going to review the problem itself, and the common metrics used to measure its performance. 

After this, I will elaborate on the object tracking method I chose as the basis, showing how it incorporates the aforementioned detectors, and the way the performance of the latter is expected to influence tracking performance.

\section{The Problem}

Multiple object tracking consists of determining the \textit{trajectory} of given kinds of objects in a video stream. In the current context, the trajectory of a single, unique instance is a series of bounding boxes, one for every frame in which the object is visible. The boxes are expected to fit the object as tightly as possible, and the trajectories have usually some kind of identity associated with them. 

The problem builds on detection, but the difficulty also comes in assigning the current detected objects a correct identity, if it has been seen previously, or a new one otherwise. This action is generally called \textit{association}. There are usually two, not necessarily exclusive approaches: association between detections in subsequent frames (the identified objects in the previous frames are expected to be close to their current location, thus associating by proximity), or overarching association by some appearance features (association by feature similarity).

Proximity-based association fails in scenarios where multiple objects of the same kind are very close to each other and dynamically moving, while visible features can vary because of the lighting condintions, orientation, occlusion or the object's own changes in appearance. Due to these problems, multiple object tracking is still a challenging task.
For a comprehensive, recent overview of the problem, see the literature review at~\cite{Luo_2021}.

In this thesis, I am going to tackle tracking vehicles in road traffic footages.

\section{Metrics}

The MOT challenge~\footnote{\url{https://motchallenge.net/}} is one of the most popular multiple object tracking  benchmarks used currently. Its most recent version is the MOT20 benchmark, introduced in   

\section{Solutions}

Most of the leading, publicly-disclosed multiple object tracking methods are detection-based, and thus are not end-to-end, as the system is not trained in one go, but for subtasks and then assembled later.
